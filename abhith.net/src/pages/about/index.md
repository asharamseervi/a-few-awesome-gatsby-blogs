My name is Abhith Rajan. I'm a [Software Engineer](https://github.com/abhith). I work for the Product Team at [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/). I blog about programming, code, technology and stuffs that I'm interested in.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abhithrajan), [GitHub](https://github.com/Abhith), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/abhith) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhithrajan/). If you just want to email me, go ahead and send an email to [abhith@pm.me](mailto:abhith@pm.me).

#### BACKGROUND

I started my career at [Aabasoft](http://aabasoft.com) where I was joined as an intern after my B-Tech and worked there for over 3 years as a Software Engineer and then moved to [Sysberries](http://sysberries.com), [Unibeton Ready Mix](http://www.unibetonrm.com/en-gl/home) and now to  [Emcredit](https://www.emcredit.com/) where I currently work.

#### INFORMATION OVERFLOW

I love racing, big fan of **Valentino Rossi**. The first thing I bought after I got my first job was my **Yamaha R15 V2** bike. And I got a cool number for that bike, KL 40J **201**. After I moved to UAE, the one thing that hurt me most is, `I MISS MY BIKE SO MUCH`.
